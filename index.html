    <p>Dear Carlo,</p>
    <br>
    <p>Happy Birthday / Bird Day / Birb Day!!! I know the past several months have been a challenge for you, but you are making it work in a newish place. I'm so proud of you for finding your job, moving on such short notice, learning the ropes in a short amount of time, and being a rock star Emergency Preparedness Coordinator.</p>
    <p>You're gonna be so stronk bike lady soon, and you'll be zoomin around the Greater Seattle Area while I struggle to keep up!  ** cue clown car / circus music! **</p>
    <p>I'm glad I get to be here with you to celebrate, and I hope you know that even if they're not all here in the same place, you have so many people who love you. And even if things get frustrating with me, or your family, or your friends, we still love you dearly. And Scrubby loves you soooo BIG!</p>
    <p>I hope even though we're not doing anything big, this day becomes another good memory and makes you feel special.I love you, honey!</p>
